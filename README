#kmail-mailbox2claws-mail.pl

  WHAT IT DOES
	
	This perl script converts a kmail mailbox into a Claws Mail mailbox.
  
  HOW TO USE IT
  
  	Exit Claws Mail if running.
	
	Run the (made executable) script using:
		kmail-mailbox2claws-mail.pl --kmaildir=/full/path/to/kmail/mailbox
	where "/full/path/to/kmail/mailbox" is the topmost kmail folder.
	In my case there were two locations:
		$ENV{HOME}/.local/share/local-mail
	and
		$ENV{HOME}/.local/share/akonadi/file_db_data
	, so I had to run the tool twice.
	
	Start Claws Mail and right-click the toplevel mailbox, i.e
	"Mailbox (MH)", and select "Rebuild folder tree"; if necessary, also
	select "Check for new messages" and "Check for new folders".
	
	Additional options:
		--debug		debug mode
		--dry-run	test mode, nothing is actually written
		--help		brief usage info
